# vuemycontacts
Simple contact database demonstrating VueJS with a Laravel backend


Motivation: As an introduction to vue development – I’ve used it to build an address book – it’s running on a PHP/Laravel 5.8.

The app is quite loose and is a straightforward introduction / easy to understand app to play around with and make changes / additions. It’s got a simple routed component structure and various bits of CRUD functionality.

Built on Vue JS 2, this app incorporates:

Laravel 5.8 Json API
Token based auth
Vue router
Bootstrap 4 UI
Basic token-auth functionality
Axios http library
